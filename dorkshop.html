        <h2>Hardware Requirements</h2>

        <hr />

        <p><span>All you need is a smartphone of a 2014 vintage or better, and a half-decent laptop.</span></p>

        <p><span>Also</span>, a fast and reliable way of transferring photos from your smartphone to a computer.</p>

        <p>You can of course use a proper camera, and the results will definitely be much better, but unless you're
            creating 4K ready assets for a AAA game or VFX production, a smartphone is really all you need. It's also
            much quicker to process photos from a smartphone, so you'll get to a textured, 3D model much faster. </p>

        <p>The same goes for a computer. You can definitely get away with using a machine like mine (Macbook Air from
            2014 with 4GB RAM), but you'll be much better off with of a faster machine. Photogrammetry is a real
            stress-test for any computer, and requires a great CPU, a great GPU, lots of (fast) RAM, and plenty of disk
            space.</p>

        <p>Windows based machines are preferred, but other systems such are quickly getting up to speed. Linux support
            is very good, and the Mac now has native photogrammetry libraries. </p>

        <h2>Software Requirements</h2>

        <hr />

        <p><span>There's a whole bunch of options available but there's a few I personally recommend.</span></p>

        <p><span><a href="https://www.capturingreality.com" target="_blank">Reality Capture</a></span>: <i>(Windows and
                Linux)</i> The industry
            standard, it's one of the best out there. It's paid, but they have a cheap trial via Steam, and it works
            well with Nvidia GPU's. Highly recommend.</p>

        <p><span><a href="https://alicevision.org/#meshroom" target="_blank">Meshroom</a></span>: <i>(Windows and
                Linux)</i> A free and open-source
            option, this is apparently very good. I haven't personally used it, but lots of people have made lots of
            approving noises about it. It's free, so no harm in trying it out. </p>

        <p><span><a href="https://www.agisoft.com" target="_blank">Metashape</a></span>: <i>(MacOS, Windows and
                Linux)</i> A great option for Mac users, it's also available for other platforms. It leverages Metal,
            the Mac GPU framework, so it's fairly efficient and fast. Highly recommend for anyone who uses a Mac. </p>

        <p><span>The Ten Commandments</span></p>
        <p>Be patient. This will take time.</p>
        <p>Not everything will work, but you won't be the first person to face your issue. Someone, somewhere has
            probably had the same issue, and the solution is probably online.</p>
        <p>Learn the rules of photogrammetry: It will make everything faster.</p>
        <p>Break the rules of photogrammetry: Once you know what works, break the rules. There's plenty of creative
            opportunities with this workflow</p>
        <p>Share what works and what doesn't.</p>
