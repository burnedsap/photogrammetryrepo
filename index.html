		<h1>Photogrammetry Repo</h1>
		
		<p class="intro">This is a small repository of knowledge on photogrammetry. Many have been asking me about photogrammetry, and I did make a small blog about it a few years ago, but now that i know how to a less worse website, this is me taking another crack at it. In the time that has passed, the internet is now awash with information about photogrammtery. In the good old days (circa 2017) photogrammetry was still a relatively novel process but now that everyone knows about this, I shall talk about a few specific use cases and some other boring things that may or may not interest you. enjoy.</p>

		<h2>What is Photogrammetry?</h2>
		
		<p>photogrammetry |ˌfəʊtə(ʊ)ˈgramɪtri| noun [ mass noun ] the use of photography in surveying and mapping to ascertain measurements between objects.</p>
		
		<p>'photo' - light 'gram' - drawing 'metry' - measurement</p>
		
		<p>Photogrammetry is the act of taking as many photos of an object and calculating distances and angles to form a 3 dimensional model. Earlier, these photos would be processed in a stereo plotter, but now this process is automated with computers.</p>
		
		<p>Also known as Image-Based Modelling, this can either be done via aerial photography, or even with a normal camera. Higher resolution, sharper photos, and photos with closer overlap generally lead to better 3D models.</p>
		
		<p>Softwares such as ReMake, PhotoScan, Reality Capture, amongst others can transform a series of images into highly detailed and textured 3D models. The best of the softwares out there for prosumers are PhotoScan and Reality Capture.</p>

		<h2>How to Photogrammetry?</h2>
		
		<p><span>After many failed attempts at photogrammetry, I’ve arrived at a process (which is still evolving) that I can share.</span></p>
		
		<p><span>First:</span> Pick a good tool to shoot photographs with. A good camera is a one that is always with you, so something nice and compact that you can carry around. A camera that is focusses rapidly, and shoots quickly is a one that will save you time as you take your photos. A wide lens is also reccommended, as long as it doesn’t suffer from any sort of distortion. Wider the lens, the more detail you can capture in one shot, which will save you from having to take too many photos.</p>
		
		<p><span>Second:</span> It’s important to remember that the quality of photos is what will define the outcome. Post-processing yields minimal improvements and is not time efficient. The better the quality of photos, the better the result. In this case, the qualities that define good traditional photography are the ones you want to avoid. Break every rule of good aesthetic photography. No depth-of-field, even lighting, no shadows or highlights. Put yourself in the shoes of a person tasked with documenting a scene of crime. Every detail, no matter how small has to be captured. You are aiming for accuracy and detail, not artistic capability.</p>
		
		<p><span>Third:</span> Track the sun and the clouds. They will either make, or break your shoot. Strong sunlight means high contrast situations, where the lit areas are too bright, and the shadows too dark. Your camera will not be able to capture all the detail. Shooting against the sun will lead to lens flares and the subsequent shadows on the object will render your image useless. Even, diffused lighting, such as the one on overcast days are ideal. Early mornings, and sunsets are the best times to capture objects.</p>
		
		<p><span>Fourth:</span> Ensure that every photo you take has atleast 60% overlap. Don’t get clever or lazy. The more photos you take, from as many different angles as possible, the better resolved your final 3D model will turn out. Don’t try and be ‘efficient’, try to work on getting the result you want from the first try. Take a round of photos from far, and then take another round of photos up close. Cover as many angles as you can. Top, bottom, left, right, everything. The more angles you cover, the more data the software has to work with. Greater the overlap, the greater the points the computer can track to match photos and create pairs. But don't get too clever and shoot too many photos with excessive overlap. It'll do your processing time no good with very little increase in detail.</p>
		
		<p><span>Fifth:</span> After shooting your photos, bring the photos into Adobe Bridge or an equivalent software and rearrange the photos into order. Ensure that the photos are in order of the orientation of the object, not necesssarily in the order of shooting. This will make the software process the photos faster.</p>
		
		<p><span>Sixth:</span> Remember all of the above.</p>

		<h2>I use PhotoScan.</h2>
		
		<p>Here's the beginner guide to using PhotoScan to get some sort of 3D mesh.
		<p><span>Step 1:</span> Open PhotoScan.</p>
		
		<p><span>Step 2:</span> Select your photos, and drag them into PhotoScan. Specifically, to the bar on the left hand side.</p>
		
		<p><span>Step 3:</span> Go to the Workflow tab on top, and select Align Photos. You will be presented with multiple levels for alignment. Lowest - Highest. Depending on your computers performance, select the appropriate option. I'd recommend Medium if you want an optimal blend of performance and time taken to render.</p>
		
		<p><span>Step 4:</span> Once the alignment is complete, you will be presented with a sparse cloud. This is when you will see whether you've taken good photos or not.</p>
		
		<p><span>Step 5:</span> If you're happy with what you see, you may proceed. If not, then try arranging the photos, masking them, and try again. Worst case scenario, you'll have to go shoot once again.</p>
		
		<p><span>Step 6:</span> If you're satisfied with what you see then, proceed to the next option in the Workflow tab. Build Dense Cloud. Again, choose whichever option suits your system. I usually choose Low, and it does a good enough job.</p>
		
		<p><span>Step 7:</span> Now that you have a Dense Cloud (you can see the Dense Cloud visually by toggling the various view options in the toolbar), you can proceed to build a mesh. Select the Build Mesh option and wait for that to finish.</p>
		
		<p><span>Step 8:</span> After the mesh is built, choose the Decimate option in Tools>Mesh to get the required settings of your choice.</p>
		
		<p><span>Step 9:</span> After you've selected the number of faces you desire, you can map the texture on to the mesh. Select the Build Mesh option in Workflow.</p>
		
		<p><span>Step 10:</span> I hope you kept saving the file as you went along. Now that you can see the ready model in front of you, export to any format you see fit.</p>
